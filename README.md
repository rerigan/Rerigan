# 👨‍💻 Hey, I'm Rerigan!
**`Developer | Brazilian`**

<p>I format PCs since I was 10, since then I've had a passion for computers and technology. At the moment I'm expanding my knowledge in Development by taking courses and also graduating in Systems Analysis and Development. <br>I've always had an analytic mind, a critical view of things, and I always notice things around me that could be bettered. <br>I always see potential for growth and development even in things people are content with. I like to solve problems and to build stuff, I hope you like what you see! :)</p>
