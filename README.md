# 👨‍💻 Hey, I'm Rerigan!
**`Developer | Brazilian`**

<p>
I started formatting PCs at the age of 10. Currently, I’m deepening my skills in development through specialized courses and a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. <br>
I’ve always had an analytical mindset and a critical eye for improvement, I tend to notice things that can be made better, even when others are content. I see potential for growth everywhere. <br>I enjoy solving problems and building solutions, and I hope you enjoy what you see! :)
